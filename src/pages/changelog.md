# Updates

## 0.1.5

##### 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Fixed the typing of `Application.events.listenEvents(events.valid)`.

- Errors thrown by `Application.connect()` now use `DisfoxError` instead of the native `Error`.

- Removed unnecessary imports.

- Fixed the return type of `SlashService.Option.channelTypes()` to `this`, allowing proper method chaining.

### Improved

- Updated the TypeScript build configuration to target `ES2022` and use Node.js-compatible module resolution, improving compatibility with the minimum supported runtime: **Node.js 20+**.

- Added and reorganized internal error codes:
  - `UNDEFINED_TOKEN`
  - `UNDEFINED_CLIENT`
  - `APPLICATION_NOT_READY`
  - `ALREADY_CONNECTED`

- The following getters no longer throw errors when the `Client` or `ClientUser` is unavailable:
  - `Application.client`
  - `Application.user`

- `Application` initialization has been simplified and now supports multiple initialization methods.

An existing `discord.js` `Client` can still be provided:

```js
import { Client, GatewayIntentBits } from "discord.js";
import { Application } from "disfox";

const client = new Client({
    intents: [GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent]
});

const app = new Application({
    token: process.env.TOKEN,
    client
});
```

Disfox can also create the `Client` automatically:

```js
import { GatewayIntentBits } from "discord.js";
import { Application } from "disfox";

const app = new Application({
    token: process.env.TOKEN,
    intents: [
        GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent
    ]
});
```

When no intents are provided, Disfox automatically configures its default intents:

```js
import { Application } from "disfox";

const app = new Application({
    token: process.env.TOKEN
});
```

Applications can now also be initialized directly from a token:

```js
import { Application } from "disfox";

const app = new Application(process.env.TOKEN);
```

> Intents automatically configured by Disfox can later be modified using the new `Application` intent management methods.

- **All initialization examples are available in:**
[Creating an Application](https://disfox.js.org/docs/disfox/0.1.5/en/Get-Started/Creating%20Application#other-initialization-methods)

### Added

- Added the new `Application.refresh()` method.

This method restarts the `Client` connection to the Discord Gateway by destroying the current connection and reconnecting.

---

- Added the `Application.addIntent()` method for adding a single intent to the configuration used during `IDENTIFY`.

---

- Added the `Application.addIntents()` method for adding multiple intents to the configuration used during `IDENTIFY`.

---

- Added the `Application.removeIntent()` method for removing an intent from the configuration used during `IDENTIFY`.

---

- Added the `Application.clearIntents()` method for removing all intents currently configured for `IDENTIFY`.

- **See the complete intent configuration documentation in:**
[Configuring Intents](https://disfox.js.org/docs/disfox/0.1.5/en/Get-Started/Creating%20Application#configuring-intents)

---

- Added support for **Option Choices** in `SlashService.Option`.

Choices can now be declared directly through the Disfox API:

```js
const option = new SlashService.Option("choice")
    .choices({
        rock: "rock",
        paper: "paper",
        scissors: "scissors"
    });
```

Equivalent configuration using `discord.js`:

```js
.addStringOption(option =>
    option
        .addChoices(
            { name: "rock", value: "rock" },
            { name: "paper", value: "paper" },
            { name: "scissors", value: "scissors" }
        )
)
```

- See the complete documentation in:
[Adding Options with Choices](https://disfox.js.org/docs/disfox/0.1.5/en/Services/SlashService#adding-options-with-choices)

### Updated

- Support for the `event.data` property in event definitions has been removed.

The following format is **no longer supported**:

```js
export default {
    data: Events.MessageCreate,

    async execute(message) {
        if (!message.content.startsWith("!mean")) return;

        await message.reply({
            content: `**@${message.author.displayName}**\n${message.content}.`
        });
    }
}
```

Events must now use the `name` property:

```js
export default {
    name: Events.MessageCreate,

    async execute(message) {
        // Event logic
    }
}
```

> **Attention:** existing event definitions using `event.data` must be updated to use the new API.

## 0.1.4
##### 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Fixed issues in `SlashService.extractFile()`.

- Cleaned up the `/dist` build directory, removing obsolete directories, legacy APIs, duplicated files, and approximately 340 outdated generated files.

- Fixed the interaction type used by `SlashService.Command.action()`, changing it from `CommandInteraction` to `ChatInputCommandInteraction` from `discord.js`.

### Improved

- Deprecated the `FileManage`, `PathManage`, and `Response` modules.

> These modules, along with all other deprecated Disfox APIs, are scheduled for removal in a future release.

- Added support for restricting channel options by Discord channel type in `SlashService.Option`.

```js
import { ChannelType } from "discord.js";
import {
    SlashService,
    SlashOptions
} from "disfox";

// Creates a channel option for the slash command.
const channelOption = new SlashService.Option("channel")
    .type(SlashOptions.Channel)
    .description("Select a channel")
    .required(true);

// Restricts the option to specific Discord channel types.
channelOption.channelTypes(
    ChannelType.GuildText,
    ChannelType.GuildVoice,
    ChannelType.GuildForum
);
```

- Added the new `SlashService.Option.channelTypes(...types: ChannelType[])` method for configuring the allowed Discord channel types of a channel option.

---

## 0.1.3
##### 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Fixed the NPM Disfox website URL to `https://disfox.netlify.app` in `package.json`.

---

## 0.1.2
##### 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- The `extractFile()` and `extractDir()` methods from the `SlashService` and `EventService` services are no longer limited to `.js` files. Files with other extensions, such as `.ts`, `.cts`, `.cjs`, and similar formats, are now supported.

- Fixed a bug in `SlashService.extractDir()` that occurred when the optional second configuration parameter was not provided, which could cause the application to stop responding correctly to the `InteractionCreate` event.

- Fixed an issue with `Application.slash.listening` where its state was not correctly updated to `true`.

- Fixed an issue between `Application.slash.listen()` and `Application.slash.deployGlobal()` that prevented new commands from being registered after the listener had already started.

```js
app.client.once(Events.ClientReady, async () => {
    console.log("Online");

    await app.slash.deployGlobal(commands.valid);

    app.slash.listen();

    // New commands can now be registered
    // even after the listener has started.
    await app.slash.deployGlobal(gamesCommands.valid);
});

```

## 0.1.1
##### 2026-06-18

## 0.1.0
##### 2026-06-18

### Added

#### New Tool: BehaviorTable
We are introducing a new tool designed to automate Slash Command behaviors. Behavior Tables are collections of rules and configurations that can be applied to one or more slash commands to define how they interact with specific users, IDs, and execution contexts.

* [Learn more about Disfox BehaviorTables](https://disfox.js.org/docs/disfox/0.1.0/en/Modules/BehaviorTables)

This tool brings greater simplicity and intelligent automation to your codebase. BehaviorTables is currently in active development, and we plan to introduce additional features to expand its capabilities in future updates.

### Updated

Command extraction via `SlashService.extractDir()` has been optimized and now accepts extraction option parameters.

Documentation available at: 

#### Optimizations
Various internal optimizations have been implemented to ensure high performance and low overhead.

#### Error Handling & Architecture
Enhanced the `DisfoxError` class to provide better organization and more detailed error reporting.

### Removed
